# ZPortfolio

Hello! I'm ZMiK0, and this is my personal portfolio. It was created for the Multimedia Programming course and as a showcase of my work.

Built with:
- **Astro.js**: A fast and modern JavaScript framework for building web applications.
- **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework designed to simplify responsive design and streamline styling.

## Installation

Clone the repo, fix possible issues with `npm install` and run it with `npm run dev` or see it deployed [here](https://zmik0.github.io/ZPortfolio/).
