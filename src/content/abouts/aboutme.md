Hey, I'm belz, or well, zmik0, I actually have quite a few names.

<br>

I want to study many things and I can’t decide on one, but I’m passionate about artificial intelligence and operating systems. I guess I’ll take one of those paths.

<br>

Currently, I’m studying a degree in cross-platform application development, where I’ve learned many languages like <span style="color:#458588">Python</span>, <span style="color:#fe8019">Java</span> , <span style="color:#d65d0e">HTML</span>, <span style="color:#83a598">CSS</span> (TailwindCSS), <span style="color:#fabd2f">JS</span> (Astro.js/React), <span style="color:#fb4934">ORACLE SQL</span>, <span style="color:#8ec07c">MongoDB</span>, as well as agile methodologies like <span style="font-weight:bold">Scrum</span>.

<br>

While working on my biggest project to date, I learned my way through the <span style="color:#bf8f5c">Rust</span> programming language and the <span style="color:#ca3a3a">Angular</span> framework.

<br>

I have extensive experience with the Google Suite as I've been using it since high school as well as a solid understanding of Linux as it has been my daily driver for over a year.

<br>

<span style="font-style:italic">I hope we work together soon</span>.
