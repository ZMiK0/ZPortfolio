Hey, I'm belz, or well, zmik0, I actually have quite a few names. I guess it’s due to my constant desire to change and improve myself.

<br>

Right now, to be honest, I’m nothing. I want to study many things and I can’t decide on one, but I’m passionate about artificial intelligence and operating systems. I guess I’ll take one of those paths.

<br>

Currently, I’m studying a degree in cross-platform application development, where I’ve learned many languages like <span style="color:#324fb8">Python</span>, <span style="color:#b87b32">Java</span> , <span style="color:#ff8c00">HTML</span>, <span style="color:#1e9dd4">CSS</span> (TailwindCSS), <span style="color:#fae900">JS</span> (Astro.js), <span style="color:#c91a37">ORACLE SQL</span>, <span style="color:#367a36">MongoDB</span>, as well as agile methodologies like <span style="font-weight:bold">Scrum</span>.

<br>

I also got experience with the Google Suite in high school and have a solid understanding of Linux. I’ve been using it as my daily driver for over a year and learning a lot about how it works.

<br>

<span style="font-style:italic">I hope we work together soon</span>.
